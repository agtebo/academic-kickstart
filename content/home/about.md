<b> I am interested in how quantum physics informs biology at the nanoscale. </b>

My future research program will build on my past successes in developing high-performance nanosensors
that essentially work due to room-temperature quantum effects under noisy environments, and in modeling
physical mechanisms employed by "living sensors". I will invest my physics training to unveil, control and
harness the advantages of evolutionarily-selected biological sensing occurring at the nanoscale.

<!-- # Apart from that, I revel in writing, teaching, and presenting my research. 

#On December 10,  -->

You will soon find here my Research, Teaching and Diversity Statements. Comments and suggestions are welcome!
